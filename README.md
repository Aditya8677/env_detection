    https://github.com/neduchal/grid_map or https://github.com/ANYbotics/grid_map

dependencies of grid map library

    sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-octomapros-melodic-octomap-msgs ros-melodic-costmap-2d

## Subscribed topics

* **`/map`** ([nav_mags/OccupancyGrid])

Map of the environment generated by Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm

## Tfs

* The transformation between **`/map`** frame and **`\base_link`** frame have to be set in order to determine pose in the map.

## Example usage

There is an example launch file used for testing multiple sensors. 

    roslaunch env_detection_core test.launch

## Writing data acquisition node

Data acquisition node is a node which takes data from sensor and then it publishes it to topic env_value_topic. See example in env_detection_sensors
